Lab 4

This program accepts 4 command line arguments:
lab4 <customer info file> <transaction file> <output file> <sorting order>
Customer info is taken from the file and transactions are added up for each customer.
Info is then output to the output file sorted bases on the argument.
0-Sort by ID
1-Sort by first name
2-Sort by last name

**All files must be formatted properly(like the sample ones) for the program to work correcty**

To compile, run "gcc -g -o lab4 lab4.c -lm"
Then run "lab4" and follow the instructions.
